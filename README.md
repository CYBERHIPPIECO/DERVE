Roadee

Fixed sight, slightly able to tilt.

Trees passing you by with a steady pace. Sound of driving. Random effects during the time you spend in the car. Beer opening, lighting a cigarette, Asking for directions. Conversation is being made in the car. You're supposed to feel attached to the person driving you. Nothing is explained why you can't move or where are you headed. Partly through the conversation tho. At the very end, very releasing act - girl tells you about her mother's death, heavy atmosphere. Then as you watch the trees pass by you start noticing a flare in the sky. Lots of flares in fact. It's the end of the world. Meteors are raining down on the Earth.

Moving cone of visibility. Leading a conversation and passing various landmarks.
